## Theme

### Wildcards
> Wildcards are an optional limitation to add a unique challenge in addition to the theme.
Pick one or pick all. It's up to you. Wildcards are revealed at the same 
time as the theme, and there are always only 3. Ignoring wildcards completely will not incur a deduction in judging.
